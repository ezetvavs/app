You can still use EzeTV the way you always did but you call also now use our new Premium IPTV HD Quality service for Live TV, which is a subscription service but once you try it you will never switch back. This goes through enhanced servers and ensures HD quality for most channels and pretty much buffer free for everything. There is nothing worse than in the middle of a football match or event, that the stream fails or starts to buffer and you have to start looking for another link. The IPTV service will ensure this does not happen plus all football matches will be in HD with English commentaries so you don't have to worry about trying 20 different links to find one that works. Watch the video on www.EzeTV.co.uk to see the IPTV in action.

IPTV has Live UK and also Live USA channels so for example you could watch the latest Walking Dead episode as it is aired live from the USA. There are also live TV guides for both the UK and USA channels and you simply click on the program and it will take you to the channel.

All existing EzeTV customers will get a FREE TRIAL of the IPTV service. Once you have downloaded the new app, please email info@ezetv.co.uk and ask for your free login details to test the IPTV service.
