The "People Watching" and "Most Popular" sections in both Movies and TV Shows has been updated to change to
links that give more results for HD links. In the "Addons" section you should browse through them to see all
the options that are available to you.

One of the best links for football matches is in the Sports Section under "All Sports Live". Then click into
VC Events and you will find the relevant links to high quality streams. 

For football stream to work well then you need to turn off "Hardware Acceleration". To do this go to SETTINGS
and click on settings (not the submenus below it), then arrow down and click on VIDEOS. Then arrow down to 
ACCELERATION. Then arrow right and turn off all hardware acceleration modes. Then click backup and it is done.

The EzeTV APP is now available in the amazon APP store, ONLY Â£5, to download to any android device
or android box or Fire TV Stick. For the Fire TV Stick, see instructions on our website.
