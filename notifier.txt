Last update 17/04/2016.

SPORTS LINK is now under the Sport's section. You can either click on Live Sports HQ and then choose from
the various sporting links or else scroll down and choose one of the live matches.

HD Football - to make the streams play better go to SETTINGS and click on settings and not the submenus below.
Then scroll down and select VIDEOS. Then scroll down to ACCELERATION and once acceleration is highlighted,
scroll right to the options. Then scroll down and switch the acceleration modes to off. This should make the
HD Football streams play better. You will have to double check this after each update.

"Movie Mix" has been added to the Movies & TV Shows sections. When you click on a movie it will play
straight away without having to choose any links. Good quality but not all links will work. Worth
checking out though.

The EzeTV APP is now available in the amazon APP store, ONLY Â£5, to download to any android device
or android box or Fire TV Stick. For the Fire TV Stick, see instructions on our website.
