Eze TV has now released Version 5 on 04-12-2017. If you are already on version 3 or 4 then you will automatically update to Version 5. The new version does not use a username of password so you will need to email info@ezetv.co.uk to REQUEST YOUR DEVICE TO BE ACTIVATED.

This new version uses our own media player and no longer uses a kodi player. Therefore it is so much faster on loading channels, etc. All our content is in the Eze Gold section and you will get access to this, once you email in for activation.

Our new version has our own built-in PRIVATE VPN, which will let you continue to watch whatevr you want while premier league matches are on. If you already have a VPN then you can continue to use it but if you don't then you can subscribe to our own private VPN.

DON'T FORGET TO TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS!!
