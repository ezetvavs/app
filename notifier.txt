Sports links have been updated so that most are now working. Project M has been added to a few sections.

New Releases and Hot Movies has been added to the Movies Section.

One of the best links for football matches (once premiership starts) is in the Sports Section under "All Sports Live". Then click into
VC Events and you will find the relevant links to high quality streams. 

For football stream to work well then you need to turn off "Hardware Acceleration". To do this go to SETTINGS
and click on settings (not the submenus below it), then arrow down and click on VIDEOS. Then arrow down to 
ACCELERATION. Then arrow right and turn off all hardware acceleration modes. Then click backup and it is done.

The EzeTV APP is now available in the amazon APP store, ONLY Â£5, to download to any android device
or android box.
